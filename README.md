# Arch Linux dotfiles

This is a collection of my preferred _dotfiles_ for Arch Linuxs.

The package includes the following utilities:

* `i3-wm`, `i3status`, `xss-lock`, `i3lock`
* `zsh`, `tmux`, `rxvt-unicode`
* `unclutter`, `autocutsel`

Additionally I added:

* hooks for `karma`, `travis`, `nvm`, `rvm`
* decent font configuration


See `PACKAGES` for an incomplete list of required packages.
